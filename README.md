## 📊 Overview  

Firestorm CAD is a professional jewelry design environment built for artists, goldsmiths, manufacturers, and CAD modelers who require a combination of high precision, flexibility, and advanced modeling capabilities. Purpose-engineered for jewelry workflows, it provides a comprehensive toolkit for creating rings, pendants, settings, bands, ornamental detailing, and custom designs with industry-accurate geometry.

The platform blends powerful parametric modeling with sculpting and CAD-grade construction tools, giving designers full control over curves, surfaces, symmetry, gemstone seats, and fine structural elements. Whether developing organic shapes or architectural pieces, Firestorm CAD maintains dimensional accuracy while offering intuitive manipulation of surfaces, edges, and profiles.

Its interface supports fluid, iterative design, featuring dynamic controls, adjustable profiles, and non-destructive modeling options. Designers can experiment with forms, refine proportions, apply creative embellishments, and produce professional-grade concepts more efficiently. Built-in visualization tools allow users to preview gemstone brilliance, metal finishes, reflections, and lighting scenarios—useful for both client presentation and design evaluation.

Firestorm CAD is deeply integrated with jewelry production standards. It includes gemstone libraries, setting templates, spacing controls, prong builders, pavé distribution tools, and precision drafting aids required for real-world manufacturing. Exporting ready-to-print, clean STL models ensures compatibility with casting workflows, resin 3D printers, and milling systems.

With its specialized toolset and production-oriented workflow, Firestorm CAD serves as a complete digital studio for jewelry professionals who need accuracy, speed, and creative freedom throughout the entire design-to-production process.
